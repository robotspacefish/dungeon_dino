### Objective:
Find as many gems as you can in a room

* Smash vases to find the gems
* You need at least half of the gems in a room to get the key to proceed to the next room
* Beware, some vases contain explosives
* Weigh your options: If you try to collect every gem you might not live to make it to the next room
